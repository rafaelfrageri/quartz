# EDR-CHITECTURE


> Generally speaking, EDRs are applications installed on a targetâ€™s workstations or servers that are designed to collect data about the security of the environment, called telemetry.

^definition


> The EDR agent is an application that controls and consumes data from sensor components, performs some basic analysis to determine whether a given activity or series of events aligns with attacker behavior, and forwards the telemetry to the main server, which further analyzes events from all agents deployed in an environment.
